Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on FBI Crime Data (2018-19)
Project Description
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the FBI Crime Data from 2018 to 2019. The dataset contains crime statistics reported by law enforcement agencies across the United States, providing insights into various crime categories such as violent crimes, property crimes, arrests, and law enforcement personnel data.

The goal of this analysis is to:

Understand crime trends and patterns across different states and cities.
Identify correlations between different crime categories.
Examine demographic and geographic influences on crime rates.
Provide data-driven visualizations for better interpretation.
Key Steps in the Analysis
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing or inconsistent values.
Standardizing column names and formats.
Filtering relevant data for the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive statistics of various crime types.
Visualization of crime trends using bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots.
State-wise and city-wise crime distribution analysis.
Correlation analysis between socio-economic factors and crime rates.
Insights & Findings

Identifying the most common and least reported crimes.
Detecting seasonal or yearly trends in crime data.
Understanding the impact of law enforcement presence on crime reduction.
Conclusion & Recommendations

Summary of key insights from the data.
Possible policy recommendations for law enforcement agencies.
Future scope for further analysis using machine learning models.
This EDA project aims to provide valuable insights into crime patterns in the U.S. and support data-driven decision-making for crime prevention and law enforcement strategies.
